    "Brief history of your project and organization": "https://registry.opendata.aws/ncar-cesm2-lens/   309T\n\nThe US National Center for Atmospheric Research partnered with the IBS Center for Climate Physics in South Korea to generate the CESM2 Large Ensemble which consists of 100 ensemble members at 1 degree spatial resolution covering the period 1850-2100 under CMIP6 historical and SSP370 future radiative forcing scenarios. Data sets from this ensemble were made downloadable via the Climate Data Gateway on June 14th, 2021. NCAR has copied a subset (currently ~500 TB) of CESM2 LENS data to Amazon S3 as part of the AWS Public Datasets Program. To optimize for large-scale analytics we have represented the data as ~275 Zarr stores format accessible through the Python Xarray library. Each Zarr store contains a single physical variable for a given model run type and temporal frequency (monthly, daily).",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "https://ncar.github.io/cesm2-le-aws/model_documentation.html\nWhen presenting results based on the CESM2 Large Ensemble in either oral or written form, please acknowledge the CESM2 Large Ensemble Community Project and supercomputing resources provided by the IBS Center for Climate Physics in South Korea, and reference the DOI of the Rodgers et al. (2021) - preprint.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "First, use AWS to download the dataset, then use https://github.com/filedrive-team/go-graphsplit to create CAR files, and finally distribute them to the SP via HTTP.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "Resources on AWS\nDescription\nProject data files\nResource type\nS3 Bucket\nAmazon Resource Name (ARN)\narn:aws:s3:::ncar-cesm2-lens\nAWS Region\nus-west-2\nAWS CLI Access (No AWS account required)\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://ncar-cesm2-lens/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1 to 1.5 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Asia other than Greater China, Greater China",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03645883 Seoul\nf03645884 Seoul\nf03644142 Hong Kong\nf03645007 Hong Kong\nf03645885 Tokyo\nf03646493 Tokyo",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
